#Pacmen Factory

Description: A simple web game to create a page full of pacmen bouncing around the window on your screen. This is an example of dynamically displaying data on a page. Built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, Pacmen can be added to the window and then ordered to fly around while bouncing off of the walls. 

How to run: Download the zip file to your computer locally and load the index.html file into a browser. 

- Click the button 'Add PacMan' to place figures on the screen
- Click the button 'Start Game' to see the pacemn move and bounce off the walls. 

Future improvements: I will continue to build on these skills to soemday make a more interactive game experience for the user.
